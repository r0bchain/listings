# Listings & Bids App

## Overview

This project is a web application built using Laravel 11, Vue 3, and Inertia.js. The application is designed to allow users to create and manage listings, as well as place bids on these listings. Additionally, users can connect their cryptocurrency wallets to pay for bids and publish new listings, providing a modern and secure payment option. The app leverages Solidity smart contracts to handle bidding processes on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. The application combines the power of Laravel for backend logic, Vue 3 for dynamic frontend interactions, and Inertia.js for seamless page transitions without the need for a traditional SPA setup.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system using Laravel's authentication scaffolding.
- **Listings Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete listings. Each listing can contain details such as a title, description, starting price, and an image.
- **Bidding System**: Registered users can place bids on active listings. The bidding system uses Solidity smart contracts, ensuring that all bid transactions are secure, transparent, and immutable on the blockchain.
- **Cryptocurrency Integration**: Users can connect their crypto wallets to pay for bids and publish new listings, offering flexibility and security in transactions.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Users receive notifications when they are outbid or when the auction ends.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel 11**: A PHP framework used for backend logic, routing, and database management.
- **Vue 3**: A progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces.
- **Inertia.js**: A modern stack that allows for building single-page applications (SPAs) without writing an API.
- **Solidity**: A smart contract programming language used for implementing the bidding system on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for designing the UI.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: The database management system used for storing listings, bids, and user data.
- **Crypto Wallet Integration**: Support for cryptocurrency transactions, enabling users to pay for bids and listings securely.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/listings-bids-app.git
    cd listings-bids-app
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    composer install
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
    - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Set up your database, cryptocurrency wallet configurations, blockchain settings, and other necessary settings in the `.env` file.

4. **Generate Application Key**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5. **Run Migrations**
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

6. **Build Frontend Assets**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

7. **Deploy Smart Contracts**
    - Deploy the Solidity smart contracts to your preferred Ethereum network (e.g., Rinkeby for testing or Mainnet for production).
    - Update your `.env` file with the smart contract addresses and ABI files.

8. **Serve the Application**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

9. **Access the Application**
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

- **Creating a Listing**: After logging in, users can create a new listing by navigating to the "Create Listing" page, filling out the form, and submitting it.
- **Placing a Bid**: Users can browse available listings and place bids on those of interest. The bidding process is securely handled via Solidity smart contracts on the blockchain.
- **Cryptocurrency Payments**: Users can connect their crypto wallets to pay for bids and to publish new listings. This feature allows for secure and fast transactions.
- **Managing Listings**: Users can view, edit, or delete their own listings from the "My Listings" section.
